Final assigment for AE4350

In Version 1 the original version of the model can be found along with the constants and some helper functions and the first version of the image generator. It should be noted that this was run on the Google Colab platform.

In Version 2 both the second version and the final version (called version 2.1) can be found along with their respective constants. An updated version of the image generator can also be found. In the DQN subfolder the Q-networks are saved. policy_net_trained is the trained final version of the DQN. To test this it should be run with the training section of main_v2.1.py commented.
